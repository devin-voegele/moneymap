### Twitter/X Strategy

**Build in Public:**

**Tweet Ideas:**
```
Just launched MoneyMap on Product Hunt! 🚀

Built it because I was tired of finance apps that felt like 
homework. This one's actually simple.

Free tier + AI coach that doesn't judge you for ordering 
too much takeout 😅

```

```
Week 1 metrics:
- 247 signups
- 89 active users
- 12 Pro upgrades
- €35.88 MRR

Not bad for a side project! Building in public is wild.
```

## 🎓 Phase 4: Community Marketing

### Reddit Strategy (Be Careful!)

**DO:**
- Provide value first
- Answer questions genuinely
- Mention your app naturally
- Follow subreddit rules

**DON'T:**
- Spam your link
- Be overly promotional
- Ignore feedback

**Subreddits:**
- r/personalfinance (comment, don't post)
- r/StudentLoans (help, then mention)
- r/povertyfinance (be sensitive)
- r/Frugal (share tips)
- r/SideProject (launch post OK)
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (share journey)

**Example Comment:**
```
I struggled with this too! What helped me was tracking 
subscriptions separately from other expenses.

I actually built a tool for this (MoneyMap) because I 
couldn't find anything simple enough. Happy to share if 
you're interested, but the key is just having visibility.
```
